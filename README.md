Long before there was object-oriented programming, there were functional programming languages such as Lisp and Scheme, but their benefits
were not much appreciated outside academic circles. Recently, functional programming has risen in importance because it is well suited for concurrent and event-driven (or “reactive”) programming. That doesn’t mean that objects are bad. Instead, the winning strategy is to blend object-oriented and functional programming. This makes sense even if you are not interested in concurrency. For example, collection libraries can be given powerful APIs if the language has a convenient syntax for function expressions.
