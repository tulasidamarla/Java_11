# Java_8

Long before there was object-oriented programming, there were functional programming languages such as Lisp and Scheme, but their benefits
were not much appreciated outside academic circles. Recently, functional programming has risen in importance because it is well suited for concurrent and event-driven (or “reactive”) programming. That doesn’t mean that objects are bad. Instead, the winning strategy is to blend object-oriented and functional programming. This makes sense even if you are not interested in concurrency. For example, collection libraries can be given powerful APIs if the language has a convenient syntax for function expressions.

The principal enhancement in Java 8 is the addition of functional programming constructs to its object-oriented roots. Some of the important features include
1)Lamdba expressions<br>
2)The Stream API<br>
3)Java FX<br>
4)New Date and Time API<br>
5)concurrency enhancements<br>
6)nashorn javascript engine<br>

Lamdba expressions
------------------
A lambda expression is a block of code with parameters. Use a lambda expression whenever you want a block of code executed at a later point in time. Lambda expressions can be converted to functional interfaces.
